# Spam_Ham_Detection_MachineLearnin
Spam is an unnecessary data using memory. It would be better if the machine itself learns to identify spam and ham saving a lot of space. So, I have tried to implement a Machine learning algorithm using CLASSIFICATION model, which would give binary outputs- either spam or ham.
